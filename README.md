# About
Hello, I'm Benjamin Fernandez. I create digital media content for the internet including my own projects and create videos under the BenInkling Pro name. Plus, I am the creator of the original character designs of Amira, Raven, and Crystal.

I am currently working on my first original project which is an Ren'Py visual novel called **Planet Crystal**. Which I'm currently working on the story and concept for the project.

# Social Media
Working on code projects is like a side-jobs for me, but I mainly do digital media content as **BenInkling Pro** but most of my work is on the website.
